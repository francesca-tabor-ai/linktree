# Profile Image Placeholder

Please add your profile image as `profile.jpg` in this directory.

The image should be:
- Square aspect ratio (e.g., 1000x1000px or 500x500px)
- High quality
- Will be displayed as a circle (24x24 on mobile, 28x28 on desktop)

Alternatively, update the `avatar` path in `src/config/profile.ts` to point to your image location.
